###### CO2103 Homework 2: Spring Boot, Spring Data and Spring Security by Joe Groves. Originally written in December 2019.
-----------

A Spring Boot application containing:

1. Spring Data - which uses a MySQL database to store hotel bookings made from the application; JPA annotations for all of the classes; CRUD repositories for the domain classes and Code Refactoring/Migration.

2. Spring Security - for the Login and Logout functions; to enable HTTPS; for authentication, so that passwords are encoded using a *PasswordEncoder*; for authorisation requests, so that only certain users with permissions are able to access certain parts of the application; and lastly, user integration so that successful and authenticated users are able to be redirected to the correct *Views*.

3. JavaDoc - to document the classes and all the fields and methods.
